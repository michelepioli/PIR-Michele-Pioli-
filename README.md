# PIR-Michele-Pioli-

The repository contains some file related to my PIR project:
PZT MODELING IN OPENNASTRAN95 FOR SCALED AIRCRAFT IN AEROELASTIC SIMILARITY

Inside the folder Open: 4 OpenNastran95 input files. 5A/5H refer to the piezoelectric material modeled. Moment/temp indicate the way of modeling them (through applied bending moments or temperature cards)

Inside the folder MSC: the same files of Open translated in MSC/Nastran language
